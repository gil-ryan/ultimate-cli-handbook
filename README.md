# ultimate-cli-handbook

The ultimate reference for copy and paste commands. I've been wanting to do this for a while, mostly to make life easier. There is currently no formality, so I'll be architecting that while simulatenously updating this repository.

This repository mostly consists of directions to immediate configurations. __Theory will not be discussed.__ I will eventually be offering __paid__ sources for networking and programming __theory__ courses. Anyway, lets get down to business!

## Networking

## Cisco

### Routing 

* [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)](https://github.com/gil-ryan/grs-networking-public/blob/master/ROUTING-SWITCHING/BGP/BGP.md#bgp)
