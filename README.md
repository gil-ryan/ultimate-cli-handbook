# ultimate-cli-handbook

The ultimate reference for copy and paste commands. I've been wanting to do this for a while, mostly to make life easier. There is currently no formality, so I'll be architecting that while simulatenously updating this repository.

## This is really for me, but it could also be for you.

This guide is supposed to be made up of copy and paste template for CLI's. If you'd like to be a contributer to this, please pull & merge or drope me a line.
